Capacity Management
-------------------

Charts and tables showing demand (Requested capacity) with a one-minute resolution promote data driven decisions for
capacity management. Charts can be broken down by user, project, queue, job size and cluster, or rolled up to show
global demand across the organization. Charts can be filtered to show only data for specific metrics, such as a project
or queue. Alternatively metrics can be excluded in order to show demand for just the specific data needed.

Contention Management
---------------------

Charts and tables showing actual utilization (Delivered capacity) with a one-minute resolution make it easy to see who
used what capacity. Combined with the capacity management graphs, this provides insight into who is getting access to
your HPC clusters. Graphs make it clear how much capacity was actually delivered, and makes it easy to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of any sharing policies in place.

Job Information
---------------

The job view shows detailed information on jobs that have finished, including graphs of pending time, resource usage,
and exit status for each task. Detailed information on job submission and execution information is available. Support
staff and end users benefit from detailed information on the job submission and execution requirements.

Job Search

for detailed information about jobs.

Job View
