cpu_time

The amount of CPU seconds consumed by the job.  This is the number of processors multiplied by the wall clock time for the job.
For example, if a job that started at 00:00 and completed at 00:01 and was assigned a single processor, it would have a cpu time of 1 minute.  However, another job that started at 00:00 and finished also at 00:01 but ran on ten processors, it would have a wall clock time of one minute, and a cpu time of ten minutes.
